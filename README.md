Installation :
--------------

- Make an appropriate setup script, see the various templates in setups.
- Run the appropriate setup/setups.*
- Build the required libraries in tarballs. You currently need to build each piece separately, will add in 
  an "all" target in due course.



Notes for the NERSC machines :
------------------------------

-- Use the appropriate Makefile (the Makefiles are tested on Edison, but should work on both Hopper and Edison)
